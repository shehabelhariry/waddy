The following is my CV summary:
```
{{cv_text}}
```

Convert this CV into a structured JSON object following the schema below.

## Instructions
- Only include sections where you find matching information in the CV text
- Set missing fields to empty string (do not omit them or use null)
- For date fields, use format "MMM YYYY" (e.g., "Jan 2024") or "Present" for current positions
- For arrays (skills, experience, education), only include items you can extract from the text
- Preserve exact field names and structure from the schema
- Return ONLY valid JSON with no markdown code fences or explanatory text
- Wrap your output in `<new_cv></new_cv>` tags

## Expected TypeScript Type
```typescript
type CV = {
  name: string;
  contact: {
    location: string | null;
    phone: string | null;
    email: string | null;
    linkedin: string | null;
  };
  title: string | null;
  summary: string | null;
  skills: string[];
  experience: Array<{
    company: string;
    location: string | null;
    roles: Array<{
      title: string;
      start_date: string;
      end_date: string; // Use "Present" for current roles
      responsibilities: string[];
    }>;
  }>;
  education: Array<{
    degree: string;
    institution: string;
    start_date: string | null;
    end_date: string | null;
  }>;
  certifications: Array<{
    name: string;
    institution: string | null;
    date: string | null;
  }>;
};
```

## Example Output Structure
```json
{{sample_json}}
```

## Specific Extraction Guidance
- **name**: Extract full name from CV
- **contact.phone**: Include country code if available, remove spaces/dashes
- **title**: Job title or professional headline
- **summary**: Professional summary or objective statement
- **skills**: Extract as individual items (e.g., "React.js", "TypeScript"), not grouped
- **experience.roles.responsibilities**: Break down into bullet points, each as separate array item
- **dates**: Use abbreviated month format "MMM YYYY" (Jan 2024, Feb 2023, etc.)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Don't wrap the JSON in ```json code fences
- ❌ Don't invent information not present in the CV
- ❌ Don't combine multiple responsibilities into one string
- ❌ Don't use full date format like "January 2024" (use "Jan 2024")
