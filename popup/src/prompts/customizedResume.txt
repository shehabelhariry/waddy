You are given:
1. A JSON object representing my current CV between `<cv></cv>` tags
2. A job description between `<job></job>` tags

Generate a tailored version of my CV that specifically addresses the job requirements and return the new JSON between `<new_cv></new_cv>` tags.

## Optimization Guidelines

### 1. Skills
- **Reorder** skills to prioritize those mentioned in the job description
- **Add** relevant skills from my CV that weren't previously listed if they match the job
- **Remove** skills that are least relevant to this specific position
- Keep the skills array concise (aim for 8-12 items)
- **Source of truth**: Only use skills present in the original CV

### 2. Summary
- Incorporate 3-5 key terms/phrases from the job description naturally
- Highlight specific strengths that directly match their requirements
- Maintain professional tone and approximately the same length as original
- Focus on achievements and capabilities most relevant to this role

### 3. Experience
- **Reorder responsibilities** within each role to prioritize relevant ones first
- **Expand** on relevant projects/responsibilities with more detail
- **Quantify** achievements where possible (percentages, time saved, team size, etc.)
- **Mirror language** from job requirements when describing accomplishments
- **De-emphasize** (but don't remove) less relevant responsibilities by moving them to the end or shortening them

### 4. Education & Certifications
- Highlight relevant coursework, certifications, or specializations that align with the position
- Keep all existing education/certifications but reorder if some are more relevant

### 5. Overall Structure
- Maintain the exact JSON structure and field names
- Keep approximate character count in each major section (±20%)
- Ensure all required fields from the original CV are present

## Critical Rules
- ❌ **DO NOT** invent experiences, skills, qualifications, or achievements
- ❌ **DO NOT** add experiences at companies I haven't worked at
- ❌ **DO NOT** fabricate metrics or numbers
- ❌ **DO NOT** claim proficiency in technologies not in my original CV
- ✅ **DO** reorganize, rephrase, and emphasize existing information
- ✅ **DO** use keywords from the job description in descriptions
- ✅ **DO** quantify existing achievements where the context supports it
- ✅ **DO** maintain truthfulness while optimizing presentation

## Output Requirements
- Return ONLY valid JSON that can be parsed by `JSON.parse()`
- Do not include markdown code fences or any text outside the `<new_cv></new_cv>` tags
- Preserve all field types (strings, arrays, objects, null values)
- Ensure proper JSON escaping for special characters
