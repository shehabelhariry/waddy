You are given:
1. A JSON object representing my CV between <cv></cv>
2. A job description between <job></job>

Generate a tailored version of my CV optimized for the given job.

Guidelines:
- Rewrite summary (1-3 sentences) to emphasize relevant experience using keywords from the job description
- Deduplicate and reorder skills to prioritize those matching the job description (keep 8-12 most relevant, remove duplicates)
- Keep ALL work experiences and education entries in reverse chronological order (most recent first)
- For multiple roles at the same company with adjacent or overlapping dates (within 1 month), merge into a single experience entry using the most recent title, combined date range, and merged bullet points
- Reorder bullet points within each experience to lead with most relevant achievements
- Adjust detail level based on relevance:
  * High relevance: 3-5 detailed bullet points
  * Medium relevance: 2-3 condensed bullet points  
  * Low relevance: 1-2 brief bullet points or just role summary
- Add a "relevance" field (high/medium/low) to each experience and education entry
- When assessing relevance, consider both job match AND recency (current/recent roles should be at least "medium")
- Update title to reflect target role when appropriate

Strict rules:
- Use ONLY information already present in the original CV
- Do NOT invent skills, experiences, companies, or metrics
- Do NOT remove any work experience or education entries
- Maintain exact JSON structure and field names
- Ensure dates are logically consistent (end dates after start dates)

Output:
- Return ONLY valid JSON wrapped in <new_cv></new_cv>
- No text outside the tags
- Ensure output can be parsed by JSON.parse()
