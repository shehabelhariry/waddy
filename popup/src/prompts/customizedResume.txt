You are given:
1. A JSON object representing my CV between <cv></cv>
2. A job description between <job></job>

Generate a tailored version of my CV optimized for the given job.

Guidelines:
- Emphasize experience, skills, and achievements most relevant to the job description
- Reorder and rephrase existing content to better match the role
- Use keywords and phrasing from the job description where appropriate
- Remove or de-emphasize less relevant information
- Keep the overall length and structure roughly the same
- Skills section should contain only the most relevant 4-6 skills
- Title should be a reflection of what's needed.
- Summary should be short (1-3) sentences.


Strict rules:
- Use ONLY information already present in the original CV
- Do NOT invent skills, experiences, companies, or metrics
- Do NOT add new technologies not listed in the CV
- Maintain the exact JSON structure and field names
- Remove all experiences that are not relevant to the job description

Output:
- Return ONLY valid JSON wrapped in <new_cv></new_cv>
- No text outside the tags
- Ensure the output can be parsed by JSON.parse()

<cv>{{cv}}</cv>
<job>{{job}}</job>
