You are given 
1. a JSON object representing my current CV between <cv></cv> tags
2. a Job description between <job></job> tags

Generate a tailored version of my CV that specifically addresses the job requirements and return the new JSON between <new_cv></new_cv> tags.

Follow these optimization guidelines:
1. Skills: Reorder skills based on relevance to the job description, add missing relevant skills, and remove less relevant ones
2. Summary: Incorporate keywords from the job description and highlight specific strengths that match their requirements
3. Experience: Emphasize and expand on relevant projects/responsibilities, quantify achievements when possible, and phrase accomplishments to mirror job requirements
4. Education: Highlight relevant coursework or certifications that align with the position
5. Maintain the same structure and approximate character count in each section as the original CV

Important:
- Preserve the original JSON structure exactly
- Don't invent experiences or qualifications I don't have
- Focus on truthful reorganization and rephrasing
- Ensure the final output is valid JSON that can be parsed

<cv>{{cv}}</cv>
